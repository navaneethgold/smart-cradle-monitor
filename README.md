## üìå Introduction
The **Smart Cradle** is an IoT-powered child monitoring and safety system designed to ensure the well-being of infants. It integrates **sensors, machine learning, and cloud-based visualization** to detect abnormal cradle movements, environmental conditions, and crying patterns.  

Our system continuously monitors the infant‚Äôs environment and sends alerts to caregivers in case of unsafe conditions such as:
- Abnormal shaking/tilting  
- Loud crying or continuous crying  
- Unfavorable environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, Motion, air quality)  

This helps parents and caregivers **reduce risks like overheating, unattended crying, and unsafe rocking** while ensuring a safer and more comfortable environment for infants.
